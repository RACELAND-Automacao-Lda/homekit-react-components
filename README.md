# HomeKit React Components

List of React Component mimicating HomeKit components from the Home application (iOS, MacOS).


## Installation

```
npm install homekit-react-components
```


## Usage

1. You first need to wrap your application with emotion ThemeProvider and pass the theme from the library.

ðŸš§ THIS IS HIGHLY SUBJECT TO CHANGE IN ORDER TO FACILITATE USERS ðŸš§

```js
import { ThemeProvider } from '@emotion/react';
import { theme } from 'homekit-react-components';

function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
      <MyApp />
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}
```

2. Use any components in your code ðŸ¤—

```js
<LightCard
  name="My Light"
  on={true}
  onToggle={() => setIsOn(...)}
/>
```
