# HomeKit React Components (WIP)

List of React Component mimicating HomeKit components from the Home application (iOS, MacOS).


## Installation

ðŸš§ THE PACKAGE IS NOT DEPLOYED YET ðŸš§

```
npm install homekit-react-components
```


## Usage

1. You first need to wrap your application with emotion ThemeProvider and pass the theme from the library.

ðŸš§ THIS IS HIGHLY SUBJECT TO CHANGE IN ORDER TO FACILITATE USERS ðŸš§

```js
import { ThemeProvider } from '@emotion/react';
import { theme } from 'homekit-react-components';

function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
      <MyApp />
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}
```

2. Use any components in your code ðŸ¤—

```js
<LightCard
  name="My Light"
  state="Off"
  isActive={true}
  handlePress={() => {}}
/>
```
